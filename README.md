# Research-Project-613 - COVID-19 Face Mask detection using MobileNetV2

In the present situation due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for to ensure the safety of people out there. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.
The model is accurate and giving 99% accuracy, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used. which is also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi, and Google Coral.
