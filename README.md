COVID-19 Face Mask detection using MobileNetV2

In the present situation due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand and to ensure the safety of people out there. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

1. A simulated dataset of 1500 images is used which has images with masks and without masks. Keras, Tensor Flow, deep learning, and OpenCV are used in this model to detect face masks in the static images.
2. MobileNetV2 is used to train the model which is computationally efficient and achieved 99 % accuracy.
3. This model will help to identify the people who are not wearing masks.
